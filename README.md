# Availity Assement

1. In college I had a group assignment to create any working program that we wanted.  So I had come up with an assignment to create
a way to help with the creation and editing of Dungeons and Dragon characters. I had succefully gathered the teammates to take on
this project and we had created this program from scratch with a proper manual as well as multiple documents on it's architecture 
and functionallity.  It was a year long process that ended with an A+ and experience that I use to this day.  Unfortunetly we had 
not learned about the wonders of GIT and the program has been lost.

2. There is a comicbook series called Gwen-Pool that I have recently read that I thought was amazing.  It follows this lady named
Gwen Poole who has somehow been sucked into the Marvel Comic Book Universe and knowing this and all of her knowledge about this universe
she realizes that there are 2 kinds of people in this world, main characters and extras.  The terrible thing about extras is that no one
cares about them and they always die.  So she dons a costume and trys to be a hero.  What is particularly interesting and why I recomend it
is because later she learns that she has abilities to actually step out of the comic panels and jump into any other she likes which creates 
this hillarious time hyjinx as well as exceptional art by the creaters.

3. Availity helps doctors and sick peolple talk to eachother and help them talk to the hospital so that they understand.  This way it is easier 
to pay the doctors and hospitals.
